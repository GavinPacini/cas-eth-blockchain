# BYOB: Build your own Blockchain

This project comprises a simple blockchain data structure, complete with a simple Proof of Work algorithm. 
Note: This project of course does not include any of the more complex parts of a running blockchain network.
E.g. Asymmetric encryption, consensus algorithms or distributed networking, and much more.
Instead it serves to teach about the basic data structure that is a blockchain, and the concept of "mining". 

This was used as part of guest lecture I gave to:

## ETH ZÃ¼rich CAS in Applied Information Technology - Module: Applied Information Technology

1. Create a new PyCharm project with the following options:
    - python-3
    - make a main.py file
2. Run the test program to make sure it works.
3. Slowly code each piece working towards `main.basic.py`, with the help of the instructor.
4. To see how mining works, code towards `main.mining.py`, with the help of the instrutor.
